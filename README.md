# Learning Notes

An assortment of notes relating to learning...anything. _Coherence_ is not only not a requirement, it is rarely achieved and honestly borderline discouraged. "Sequential/Linear" thought is rare; let them branch out, trail off, be born again and breathe a bit...

There will obviously be some overlap with concepts outside of the "Technology" concept (i.e. implementing math via
technology), but....whatever man....

This repo will intentionally have a very flat structure, which is to say notes will _not_ be organized into
sub-directories. The idea here is to enable the user (namely myself) to be able to search for files from the command
line and locate all files where an answer might be located.

There are some files that have LaTex in them, and therefore should be read using an application that supports the
rendering of LaTex. I currently use [Typora](https://typora.io/), which renders LaTeX nicely and the output can be
exported to various filetypes.
