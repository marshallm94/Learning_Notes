# CART Algorithm

### Classification and Regression Trees

Decision trees, whether they are used for a continuous (regression) or discrete (classification) target variable, implement an algorithm called *Recursive Binary Splitting*.

##### Recursive Binary Splitting

1. Search over the entire feature space, looking for the feature *j* and the value within that feature $*v_j*$
